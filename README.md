# ORM_Django_DB_Softuni
My studies with Softuni module Database, ORM 


The course covers the basics of Mapping between a relational base and an object-oriented model (ORM) with a focus on Django Framework. It begins with an introduction to the ORM and its key concepts before moving on to Django models, including defining models, fields and methods. The course is then deepened in topics of advanced Django migration and administrator interface, requests, models between models and inheritance. Students will also learn more sophisticated techniques for working with models and working with ORM requests in Djnago. The course also covers another popular Python Orm Framework - Sqlalchemy, which offers an alternative approach. During the training, exercises will be provided to help participants consolidate their knowledge at every step. By the end of this course, they will acquire basic skills to build stable, large -scale and effective web applications managed by databases using Python Orm Frameworks.
